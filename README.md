SEDC 73600: Curriculum Design For Computer Science

-----

### General Overview
In this unit, students will be able to import the Bootstrap library into their HTML file and utilize the various components (such as the photo carousel or the dropdown accordion feature) to make a more professional and dynamic website. This will be taught in the semester-long 10th grade Web Development class after students have learned the basics of HTML and CSS. By the end of the unit, students will make a professional travel blog that utilize at least 3 Bootstrap components.

### Motivation for Unit

We decided to make this Unit focusing on extending layout features because it is important for students to be exposed to libraries and the possibility of quickly using code to dramatically enhance a website. Learning to use containers, divs, advanced CSS, allows greater access to more powerful features of front end web development.  Javascript is the language used by the Bootstrap platform. Another motivating factor is to have units that extend the curriculum for differentiation purposes.

### Tools Used

Categorizing tools into overarching themes gives the following: Programming , Communication, Collaboration, Code/Work Collection,  Presentation, Learning Management, and OS.  We choose to use either Windows or Mac OS as the Operating System.  We each teach at different schools and this Unit is intended to be used in any public school classroom with either Windows or Mac OS.  We are also choosing Replit as both our IDE and Code/Work Collection tool.  Replit has many programming languages to choose from, and for this Unit we will be using HTML, CSS, Javascript.  Replit also has a lot more features that are useful in our Unit like multiplayer, and teams/classroom, and auto-saving. Finally, we will use Google Classroom as our Communication Tool.  This choice of tool easily syncs with their DOE schools account and provides a platform to send assignments, give comments, and send messages. There is no need for additional accounts for the students. Google Classroom will be used in our Unit to post the assignments and assessments.  Feedback will also be given using a combination of Google Classroom and Replit. A lot of these features are also free which we need in our schools. The tools used in this unit are appropriate for the content of advanced layout web design and using libraries.  The tools mentioned previously are also intended for 8th -12th grade.

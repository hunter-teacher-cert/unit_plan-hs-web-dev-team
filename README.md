# BOOTSTRAP
by Shana Henry, Yenmin Young and Christine Marra

-----

### General Overview
In this unit, students will be able to import the Bootstrap library into their HTML file and utilize the various components (such as the photo carousel or the dropdown accordion feature) to make a more professional and dynamic website. This will be taught in the semester-long 10th grade Web Development class after students have learned the basics of HTML and CSS. By the end of the unit, students will make a professional travel blog that utilize at least 3 Bootstrap components.

### Motivation for Unit

We decided to make this Unit focusing on extending layout features because it is important for students to be exposed to libraries and the possibility of quickly using code to dramatically enhance a website. Learning to use containers, divs, advanced CSS, allows greater access to more powerful features of front end web development.  Javascript is the language used by the Bootstrap platform. Another motivating factor is to have units that extend the curriculum for differentiation purposes.

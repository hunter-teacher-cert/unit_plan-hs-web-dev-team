      <h3>Italy</h3>
      <p>Italy is the land of pasta, romance, and beautiful cathedrals. First, we went to Rome and saw the Colosseum where the Gladiators fought. Then, we traveled to Florence, and climbed the stairs of a huge cathedral. (We also ran into a friend who was studying abroad there!) Lastly, we took an overnight bus which rode through the night to Venice. When we arrived, we took a quick birdy bath in a public restroom (no smelly pits!) and took a boat ride along the canals. Next step: Croatia!</p>

      <h3>Croatia</h3>
      <p>In my opinion, Croatia was one of the most underrated countries in Europe. The food is fantastic, and their currency, the Kuna, is a lot less than the Euro. That meant everything was cheaper for us! A hearty meal could cost $5 easily. First, we took a bus to the Plitvice Lakes, which is a series of 16 cascading lakes, that waterfall into the next lake. According to legend, there was a long drought in the region. The locals prayed to the magic queen, who listened and brought so much rain and wind, that it formed huge lakes. There are over 90 waterfalls in this National Park! After spending a day at the Plitvice Lakes, we took another bus to Dubrovnik, which is kind of like a huge fortress of a city. It has huge castle walls, right along the water! (Actually, part of Game of Thrones was filmed there.) We went to the seaside cliffs and jumped 5 meters into the ocean below. What an adventure!</p>

      <h3>Greece</h3>
      <p>Lastly, we went to Greece. We flew directly to Santorini, one of the spectular islands, with bright white buildings and brilliant blue domes. We watched the sunset over the water's horizon and ate fresh olives, grown local from the volcanic soil. Some of the beaches there had black sand from the lava! We flew to Athens and toured the Parthenon and classical sculpture gardens. I also found a really cute shirt with Bubble Tea on it at a thrift store.✌️</p>
